            <h2>C-CDA on FHIR Implementation Guide (IG)</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p><a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=408">C-CDA</a> is one of the most widely implemented
                implementation guides for CDA and covers a significant scope of clinical care. Its target of the 'common/essential' elements of
                healthcare is closely aligned with FHIR's focus on the '80%'. There is significant interest in industry and government in the ability
                to interoperate between CDA and FHIR and C-CDA is a logical starting point. Implementers and regulators have both expressed an
                interest in the ability to map between FHIR and C-CDA.</p>
            <p>This Implementation Guide defines a series of FHIR profiles on the Composition resource to represent the various document types in
                C-CDA. This release does not directly map every C-CDA template to FHIR profiles, rather tries to accomplish the C-CDA use case using
                Composition resource profiles created under this project (the equivalent of Level 2 CDA documents), and linking to the profiles
                created under the Data Access Framework (DAF) project for any coded entries that would normally be included in C-CDA sections. The
                hope is that this results in a simpler, more streamlined standard that reuses existing work and focuses on the 80% that implementers
                actually need in production systems (the hope is that DAF represents that 80% needed for coded entries).</p>
            <p>The Composition profiles in this IG do not require coded data in any section. This is a departure from C-CDA, which requires coded data
                for Problems, Results, Medications, etc. his departure is intentional, as the C-CDA requirement for one or more coded entries in these
                sections resulted in some very complicated workarounds using nullFlavors to handle the fact that sometimes a patient is not on any
                medications, or has no current problems. In general, FHIR takes the approach that if something is nullable, it should simply be
                optional to ease the burden on implementers, thus C-CDA on FHIR does not require any coded entries, but rather uses the "required if
                known" approach, meaning that if an implementer's system has data for a section that requires data under Meaningful Use, they need to
                sent it, but if they have no data there is no need for a null entry. </p>
            <p>We encourage feedback on these Composition profiles, and the general approach to the project as a whole. We also encourage implementers
                who wish to see more of the coded data from C-CDA mapped to FHIR to comment on the DAF project and make their requests known there.
                Once DAF creates new profiles, this project can reference them.</p>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>To represent Consolidated CDA Templates for Clinical Notes (C-CDA) 2.1 templates using FHIR profiles.<br /> This first stage of the
                project defines all the C-CDA document-level profiles on the Composition resource and contained sections.<br /><br /> Any coded data
                used by sections will be accomplished by referencing relevant U.S. Data Access Framework (DAF) FHIR profiles. </p>

        <td>This profile was originally based on the Continuity of Care Document (CCD) Release 1.1 which itself was derived from HITSP C32 and CCD
            Release 1.0. The Continuity of Care Document (CCD) profile represents a core data set of the most relevant administrative, demographic,
            and clinical information facts about a patient's healthcare, covering one or more healthcare encounters. It provides a means for one
            healthcare practitioner, system, or setting to aggregate all of the pertinent data about a patient and forward it to another to support
            the continuity of care. The primary use case for the CCD is to provide a snapshot in time containing the germane clinical, demographic,
            and administrative data for a specific patient. The key characteristic of a CCD is that the Composition.event.code is constrained to
            "PCPR". This means it does not function to report new services associated with performing care. It reports on care that has already been
            provided. The CCD provides a historical tally of the care over a range of time and is not a record of new services delivered. More
            specific use cases, such as a Discharge Summary, Transfer Summary, Referral Note, Consultation Note, or Progress Note, are available as
            alternative profiles.</td>

            applicable The care, treatment, and services provided The patients condition and disposition at discharge Information provided to the

            patient is inpatient or ambulatory. The Consultation Note should also be used to summarize an Emergency Room or Urgent Care encounter. A

            and Care Team Members prioritized concerns, goals, and planned interventions. It serves as a blueprint shared by all Care Team Members
            (including the patient, their caregivers and providers), to guide the patients care. A Care Plan integrates multiple interventions
            proposed by multiple providers and disciplines for multiple conditions. A Care Plan represents one or more Plan(s) of Care and serves to
            reconcile and resolve conflicts between the various Plans of Care developed for a specific patient by different providers. While both a
            plan of care and a care plan include the patients life goals and require Care Team Members (including patients) to prioritize goals and
            interventions, the reconciliation process becomes more complex as the number of plans of care increases. The Care Plan also serves to
            enable longitudinal coordination of care. The Care Plan represents an instance of this dynamic Care Plan at a point in time. The
            composition itself is NOT dynamic. Key differentiators between a Care Plan profile and CCD profile (another snapshot in time document): *
            Requires relationships between various concepts: * Health Concerns * Interventions * Goals * Outcomes * Provides the ability to identify
            patient and provider priorities with each act * Provides a header participant to indicate occurrences of Care Plan review</td>

            the indications for the procedure and, when applicable, postprocedure diagnosis, pertinent events of the procedure, and the patients
            tolerance for the procedure. It should be detailed enough to justify the procedure, describe the course of the procedure, and provide

        <td>A History and Physical (H &amp; P) note is a medical report that documents the current and past conditions of the patient. It contains
            essential information that helps determine an individual's health status. The first portion of the report is a current collection of
            organized information unique to an individual. This is typically supplied by the patient or the caregiver, concerning the current medical
            problem or the reason for the patient encounter. This information is followed by a description of any past or ongoing medical issues,
            including current medications and allergies. Information is also obtained about the patient's lifestyle, habits, and diseases among family
            members. The next portion of the report contains information obtained by physically examining the patient and gathering diagnostic
            information in the form of laboratory tests, imaging, or other diagnostic procedures. The report ends with the clinician's assessment of
            the patient's situation and the intended plan to address those issues. A History and Physical Examination is required upon hospital
            admission as well as before operative procedures. An initial evaluation in an ambulatory setting is often documented in the form of an
            H&amp;P note.</td>

            the time of the previous note and the most recent note. Mosbys medical dictionary defines a Progress Note as Notes made by a nurse,

            given or planned. A Progress Note is not a re-evaluation note. A Progress Note is not intended to be a Progress Report for Medicare.

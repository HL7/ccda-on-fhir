      <h3>
         <a name="S_Health_Concerns_Section_V2">Health Concerns Section </a>
      </h3>
      <p>This section contains data describing an interest or worry about a health state or process that could possibly require attention, 
      intervention, or management. A Health Concern is a health related matter that is of interest, importance or worry to someone, who may 
      be the patient, patient's family or patient's health care provider. Health concerns are derived from a variety of sources within an EHR 
      (such as Problem List, Family History, Social History, Social Worker Note, etc.). Health concerns can be medical, surgical, nursing, 
      allied health or patient-reported concerns. 
      Problem Concerns are a subset of Health Concerns that have risen to the level of importance that they typically would belong on a 
      classic &#x201c;Problem List&#x201d;, such as &#x201c;Diabetes Mellitus&#x201d; or &#x201c;Family History of Melanoma&#x201d; 
      or &#x201c;Tobacco abuse&#x201d;. These are of broad interest to multiple members of the care team. 
      Examples of other Health Concerns that might not typically be considered a Problem Concern include &#x201c;Risk of Hyperkalemia&#x201d; 
      for a patient taking an ACE-inhibitor medication, or &#x201c;Transportation difficulties&#x201d; for someone who doesn't drive and 
      has trouble getting to appointments, or &#x201c;Under-insured&#x201d; for someone who doesn't have sufficient insurance to properly 
      cover their medical needs such as medications. These are typically most important to just a limited number of care team members.</p>
      <p>The Health Concerns Section contains, when available, concerns as expressed by the patient and/or the patient's agent(s), and/or by the patient or other care team members. 
When the Problem Section and Health Concerns Section both appear in a single document, then the Health Concerns section is titled "Additional Health Concerns" to distinguish it from the Problem List (the author's concerns). If it were simply titled Health Concerns, some would think that it contains all
concerns, including the Problem List, which could cause confusion. Also, the Health Concerns Section appears after the Problem Section in the documents. 
The Health Concerns Section does not duplicate the entries from the Problem List. However, it may include some of the same concerns in the Problem List. 
It may be formatted as a "list" but may also be free form narrative not in any particular format. Whereas the Problems Section must contain both structured entries and narrative, the 2015 Edition Certification Criteria for Health Concerns section is only narrative. C-CDA conformance requires structured entries which may be populated with relevant data or the appropriate nullFlavor. 
Patient concerns may be specific to an encounter, or overarching concerns not specific to an encounter. Patient concerns are not limited to medical problems. For example, they can include things like barriers (lack of transportation, lack of finances, difficulty communicating with provider) or anything else relevant to the document/care. 
Also, the Additional Health Concerns section may contain concerns from members of the care team other than the author/attester of the document. The author/owner of each concern or group of concerns within the Additional Health Concerns section should be clearly labeled (e.g. Patient, Nurse, Therapist).</p><p>Referenced in:

The scope includes hematology, chemistry, serology, virology, toxicology, microbiology, plain x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, angiography, echocardiography, nuclear medicine, pathology, and procedure observations. This section often includes notable results such as abnormal values or relevant trends, and could record all results for the period of time being documented.

Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology, microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory.
Imaging results are typically generated by a clinician reviewing the output of an imaging procedure, such as when a cardiologist reports the left ventricular ejection fraction based on the review of an echocardiogram.

Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician wanting to provide more granular information about component observations made during the performance of a procedure, such as when a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy.

Note that there are discrepancies between CCD and the lab domain model, such as the effectiveTime in specimen collection.</p>

Interventions include actions that may be ongoing (e.g., maintenance medications that the patient is taking, or monitoring the patient&#x2019;s health status or the status of an intervention).

Instructions are nested within interventions and may include self-care instructions. Instructions are information or directions to the patient and other providers including how to care for the individual&#x2019;s condition, what to do at home, when to call for help, any additional appointments, testing, and changes to the medication list or medication instructions, clinical guidelines and a summary of best practice.

Instructions are information or directions to the patient. Use the Instructions Section when instructions are included as part of a document that is not a Care Plan. Use the Interventions Section, containing the Intervention Act containing the Instruction entry, when instructions are part of a structured care plan.</p>

Each unique instance of a payer and all the pertinent data needed to contact, bill to, and collect from that payer should be included. Authorization information that can be used to define pertinent referral, authorization tracking number, procedure, therapy, intervention, device, or similar authorizations for the patient or provider, or both should be included. At a minimum, the patient&#x2019;s pertinent current payment sources should be listed.
The sources of payment are represented as a Coverage Activity, which identifies all of the insurance policies or government or other programs that cover some or all of the patient's healthcare expenses. The policies or programs are sequenced by preference. The Coverage Activity has a sequence number that represents the preference order. Each policy or program identifies the covered party with respect to the payer, so that the identifiers can be recorded.</p>

         <a name="S_Plan_of_Treatment_Section_V2">Plan of Treatment Section </a>
      </h3>
      <p>This section, formerly known as "Plan of Care", contains data that define pending orders, interventions, encounters, services, and procedures for the patient. It is limited to prospective, unfulfilled, or incomplete orders and requests only. These are indicated by the @moodCode of the entries within this section. All active, incomplete, or pending orders, appointments, referrals, procedures, services, or any other pending event of clinical significance to the current care of the patient should be listed.
Clinical reminders are placed here to provide prompts for disease prevention and management, patient safety, and healthcare quality improvements, including widely accepted performance measures.
The plan may also indicate that patient education will be provided.
When used in a document that includes a Goals Section, all the goals (whether narrative only, or structured Goal Observation entries) should be recorded in the Goals Section, rather than in the Plan of Treatment Section, to avoid confusion as to &#x201c;which/whose goals should be in which section?&#x201d;
When used in a document that does not include a Goals Section, the Plan of Treatment section may also contain information about care team members&#x2019; goals, including the patient&#x2019;s values, beliefs, preferences, care expectations, and overarching care goals. Values may include the importance of quality of life over longevity. These values are taken into account when prioritizing all problems and their treatments. Beliefs may include comfort with dying or the refusal of blood transfusions because of the patient&#x2019;s religious convictions. Preferences may include liquid medicines over tablets, or treatment via secure email instead of in person. Care expectations may range from being treated only by female clinicians, to expecting all calls to be returned within 24 hours. Overarching goals described in this section are not tied to a specific condition, problem, health concern, or intervention. Examples of overarching goals could be to minimize pain or dependence on others, or to walk a daughter down the aisle for her marriage.</p>

The section should include notable procedures, but can contain all procedures for the period of time being summarized. The common notion of "procedure" is broader than that specified by the HL7 Version 3 Reference Information Model (RIM), therefore this section contains procedure templates represented with three RIM classes: Act, Observation, and Procedure. Procedure Activity Procedure (V2) is for procedures that alter the physical condition of a patient (e.g., splenectomy). Procedure Activity Observation (V2) is for procedures that result in new information about a patient but do not cause physical alteration (e.g., EEG). Procedure Activity Act (V2) is for all other types of procedures (e.g., dressing change).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This section describes all interventional, surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures or treatments pertinent to the patient historically at the time the document is generated. The section should include notable procedures, but can contain all procedures for the period of time being summarized. The common notion of "procedure" is broader than that specified by the HL7 Version 3 Reference Information Model (RIM), therefore this section contains procedure templates represented with three RIM classes: Act. Observation, and Procedure. Procedure act is for procedures that alter the physical condition of a patient (e.g., splenectomy). Observation act is for procedures that result in new information about a patient but do not cause physical alteration (e.g., EEG). Act is for all other types of procedures (e.g., dressing change).</p>

      <p>This section contains the results of observations generated by laboratories, imaging and other procedures. The scope includes observations of hematology, chemistry, serology, virology, toxicology, microbiology, plain x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, angiography, echocardiography, nuclear medicine, pathology, and procedure observations.
This section often includes notable results such as abnormal values or relevant trends. It can contain all results for the period of time being documented.

Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology, microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory.

Imaging results are typically generated by a clinician reviewing the output of an imaging procedure, such as where a cardiologist reports the left ventricular ejection fraction based on the review of a cardiac echocardiogram.

Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician to provide more granular information about component observations made during a procedure, such as where a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy.</p>

            <h2>C-CDA on FHIR Implementation Guide (IG)</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p><a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=408">C-CDA</a> is one of the most widely implemented
                implementation guides for CDA and covers a significant scope of clinical care. Its target of the 'common/essential' elements of
                healthcare is closely aligned with FHIR's focus on the '80%'. There is significant interest in industry and government in the ability
                to interoperate between CDA and FHIR and C-CDA is a logical starting point. Implementers and regulators have both expressed an
                interest in the ability to map between FHIR and C-CDA.</p>
            <p>This Implementation Guide defines a series of FHIR profiles on the Composition resource to represent the various document types in
                C-CDA. This release does not directly map every C-CDA template to FHIR profiles, rather tries to accomplish the C-CDA use case using
                Composition resource profiles created under this project (the equivalent of Level 2 CDA documents), and linking to the profiles
                created under the Data Access Framework (DAF) project for any coded entries that would normally be included in C-CDA sections. The
                hope is that this results in a simpler, more streamlined standard that reuses existing work and focuses on the 80% that implementers
                actually need in production systems (the hope is that DAF represents that 80% needed for coded entries).</p>
            <p>The Composition profiles in this IG do not require coded data in any section. This is a departure from C-CDA, which requires coded data
                for Problems, Results, Medications, etc. his departure is intentional, as the C-CDA requirement for one or more coded entries in these
                sections resulted in some very complicated workarounds using nullFlavors to handle the fact that sometimes a patient is not on any
                medications, or has no current problems. In general, FHIR takes the approach that if something is nullable, it should simply be
                optional to ease the burden on implementers, thus C-CDA on FHIR does not require any coded entries, but rather uses the "required if
                known" approach, meaning that if an implementer's system has data for a section that requires data under Meaningful Use, they need to
                sent it, but if they have no data there is no need for a null entry. </p>
            <p>We encourage feedback on these Composition profiles, and the general approach to the project as a whole. We also encourage implementers
                who wish to see more of the coded data from C-CDA mapped to FHIR to comment on the DAF project and make their requests known there.
                Once DAF creates new profiles, this project can reference them.</p>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>To represent Consolidated CDA Templates for Clinical Notes (C-CDA) 2.1 templates using FHIR profiles.<br /> This first stage of the
                project defines all the C-CDA document-level profiles on the Composition resource and contained sections.<br /><br /> Any coded data
                used by sections will be accomplished by referencing relevant U.S. Data Access Framework (DAF) FHIR profiles. </p>

        </td>
        <td>This profile was originally based on the Continuity of Care Document (CCD) Release 1.1 which itself was derived from HITSP C32 and CCD
            Release 1.0. The Continuity of Care Document (CCD) profile represents a core data set of the most relevant administrative, demographic,
            and clinical information facts about a patient's healthcare, covering one or more healthcare encounters. It provides a means for one
            healthcare practitioner, system, or setting to aggregate all of the pertinent data about a patient and forward it to another to support
            the continuity of care. The primary use case for the CCD is to provide a snapshot in time containing the germane clinical, demographic,
            and administrative data for a specific patient. The key characteristic of a CCD is that the Composition.event.code is constrained to
            "PCPR". This means it does not function to report new services associated with performing care. It reports on care that has already been
            provided. The CCD provides a historical tally of the care over a range of time and is not a record of new services delivered. More
            specific use cases, such as a Discharge Summary, Transfer Summary, Referral Note, Consultation Note, or Progress Note, are available as
            alternative profiles.</td>

        </td>
        <td>The Discharge Summary is a document which synopsizes a patient's admission to a hospital, LTPAC provider, or other setting. It provides
            information for the continuation of care following discharge. The Joint Commission requires the following information to be included in
            the Discharge Summary (http://www.jointcommission.org/): The reason for hospitalization (the admission) The procedures performed, as
            applicable The care, treatment, and services provided The patients condition and disposition at discharge Information provided to the
            patient and family Provisions for follow-up care The best practice for a Discharge Summary is to include the discharge disposition in the
            display of the header.</td>

        <td>The Consultation Note is generated by a request from a clinician for an opinion or advice from another clinician. Consultations may
            involve face-to-face time with the patient or may fall under the auspices of telemedicine visits. Consultations may occur while the
            patient is inpatient or ambulatory. The Consultation Note should also be used to summarize an Emergency Room or Urgent Care encounter. A
            Consultation Note includes the reason for the referral, history of present illness, physical examination, and decision-making components
            (Assessment and Plan).</td>

        <td>A Referral Note communicates pertinent information from a provider who is requesting services of another provider of clinical or
            non-clinical services. The information in this document includes the reason for the referral and additional information that would augment
            decision making and care delivery. Examples of referral situations are: * When a patient is referred from a family physician to a
            cardiologist for cardiac evaluation. * When patient is sent by a cardiologist to an emergency department for angina. * When a patient is
            referred by a nurse practitioner to an audiologist for hearing screening. * When a patient is referred by a hospitalist to social
            services.</td>

        </td>
        <td>CARE PLAN FRAMEWORK A Care Plan (including Home Health Plan of Care (HHPoC)) is a consensus-driven dynamic plan that represents a patients
            and Care Team Members prioritized concerns, goals, and planned interventions. It serves as a blueprint shared by all Care Team Members
            (including the patient, their caregivers and providers), to guide the patients care. A Care Plan integrates multiple interventions
            proposed by multiple providers and disciplines for multiple conditions. A Care Plan represents one or more Plan(s) of Care and serves to
            reconcile and resolve conflicts between the various Plans of Care developed for a specific patient by different providers. While both a
            plan of care and a care plan include the patients life goals and require Care Team Members (including patients) to prioritize goals and
            interventions, the reconciliation process becomes more complex as the number of plans of care increases. The Care Plan also serves to
            enable longitudinal coordination of care. The Care Plan represents an instance of this dynamic Care Plan at a point in time. The
            composition itself is NOT dynamic. Key differentiators between a Care Plan profile and CCD profile (another snapshot in time document): *
            Requires relationships between various concepts: * Health Concerns * Interventions * Goals * Outcomes * Provides the ability to identify
            patient and provider priorities with each act * Provides a header participant to indicate occurrences of Care Plan review</td>

        <td>A Procedure Note encompasses many types of non-operative procedures including interventional cardiology, gastrointestinal endoscopy,
            osteopathic manipulation, and many other specialty fields. Procedure Notes are differentiated from Operative Notes because they do not
            involve incision or excision as the primary act. The Procedure Note is created immediately following a non-operative procedure. It records
            the indications for the procedure and, when applicable, postprocedure diagnosis, pertinent events of the procedure, and the patients
            tolerance for the procedure. It should be detailed enough to justify the procedure, describe the course of the procedure, and provide
            continuity of care.</td>

        </td>
        <td>A History and Physical (H &amp; P) note is a medical report that documents the current and past conditions of the patient. It contains
            essential information that helps determine an individual's health status. The first portion of the report is a current collection of
            organized information unique to an individual. This is typically supplied by the patient or the caregiver, concerning the current medical
            problem or the reason for the patient encounter. This information is followed by a description of any past or ongoing medical issues,
            including current medications and allergies. Information is also obtained about the patient's lifestyle, habits, and diseases among family
            members. The next portion of the report contains information obtained by physically examining the patient and gathering diagnostic
            information in the form of laboratory tests, imaging, or other diagnostic procedures. The report ends with the clinician's assessment of
            the patient's situation and the intended plan to address those issues. A History and Physical Examination is required upon hospital
            admission as well as before operative procedures. An initial evaluation in an ambulatory setting is often documented in the form of an
            H&amp;P note.</td>

            Note is created immediately following a surgical or other high-risk procedure. It records the pre- and post-surgical diagnosis, pertinent
            events of the procedure, as well as the condition of the patient following the procedure. The report should be sufficiently detailed to
            support the diagnoses, justify the treatment, document the course of the procedure, and provide continuity of care.</td>

            healthcare encounter. Tabers medical dictionary defines a Progress Note as An ongoing record of a patient's illness and treatment.
            Physicians, nurses, consultants, and therapists record their notes concerning the progress or lack of progress made by the patient between
            the time of the previous note and the most recent note. Mosbys medical dictionary defines a Progress Note as Notes made by a nurse,
            physician, social worker, physical therapist, and other health care professionals that describe the patient's condition and the treatment
            given or planned. A Progress Note is not a re-evaluation note. A Progress Note is not intended to be a Progress Report for Medicare.

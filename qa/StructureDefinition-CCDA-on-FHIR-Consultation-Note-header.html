<p>The Consultation Note is generated by a request from a clinician for an opinion or advice from another clinician. Consultations may involve face-to-face time with the patient or may fall under the auspices of telemedicine visits. Consultations may occur while the patient is inpatient or ambulatory. The Consultation Note should also be used to summarize an Emergency Room or Urgent Care encounter.</p>
<p>A Consultation Note includes the reason for the referral, history of present illness, physical examination, and decision-making components (Assessment and Plan).</p>

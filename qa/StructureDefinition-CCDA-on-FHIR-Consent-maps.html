 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issued</td><td>Act.availabilityTime.  Definition: A time expression specifying when an Observation, Procedure, or other Act occurs, or, depending on the mood, is supposed to occur, scheduled to occur, etc. The activityTime includes the times of component actions (such as preparation and clean-up). For Procedures and SubstanceAdministrations, the activityTime can provide a needed administrative function by providing a more inclusive time to be anticipated in scheduling. UsageNotes:The activityTime is primarily of administrative rather than clinical use. The clinically relevant time is the effectiveTime. When an observation of a prior symptom is made, the activityTime describes the time the observation is made, as opposed to effectiveTime which is the time the symptom is reported to have occurred. Thus the activityTime may be entirely different from the effectiveTime of the same Act. However, even apart from clinical use cases, designers should first consider effectiveTime as the primary relevant time for an Act. ActivityTime indicates when an Act occurs, not when it is recorded.</td> </tr>

For example, RoleCode: HLD (held entity) Description: Entity that is currently in the possession of a holder (scoper), who holds, or uses it, usually based on some agreement with the owner. MANU (manufactured product) Description: Scoped by the manufacturer. OWN (owned entity) Description: An Entity (player) for which someone (scoper) is granted by law the right to call the material (player) his own. This entitles the scoper to make decisions about the disposition of that material. WRTE (warranted product) Description:A role a product plays when a guarantee is given to the purchaser by the seller (scoping entity) stating that the product is reliable and free from known defects and that the seller will repair or replace defective parts within a given time limit and under certain conditions.</td> </tr>

A physical place or site with its containing structure. May be natural or man-made. The geographic position of a place may or may not be constant.CONCEPT DOMAIN: TerritoryEntityType Description: A territorial entity that may be cited as the body over which an agency exercises jurisdiction, or which defines a sphere in which a party has a particular responsibility. CONCEPT DOMAIN: OrganizationEntityTypeDescription: Further classifies entities of EntityClass ORG.</td> </tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type</td><td>Maps to multiple ActClass and ActCode Concept Domains and Code Systems such as the following:   In the ActClass Concept Domain: ActClassPolicy. In the ActCode Concept Domain:   ActContractType, which generalizes ActFinancialContractType, ActCoverageType, ActBillingArrangementType.  ActConsentType, which generalizes ActDataConsentType; ActFinancialParticipationConsentType; ActInformationAccessCode; AdvanceBeneficiaryNoticeType.  ActPolicyType, which generalizes: ActPrivacyPolicyType, ActSensitivityPrivacyPolicyType, ActSecurityPolicyType.  In the ActClass Code System:  CNTRCT (contract) Description: An agreement of obligation between two or more parties that is subject to contractual law and enforcement, lwhich generalizes FCNTRCT (financial contract) and COV (coverage).  POLICY (policy) - Description: A mandate, regulation, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation unilaterally imposed by one party on: The activity of another party; the behavior of another party; or the manner in which an act is executed. LEAF CONCEPTS: JURISPOL (jurisdictional policy) Description:A mandate, regulation, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation unilaterally imposed by a jurisdiction on: The activity of another party; the behavior of another party; or the manner in which an act is executed.Examples:A jurisdictional mandate regarding the prescribing and dispensing of a particular medication. A jurisdictional privacy or security regulation dictating the manner in which personal health information is disclosed. A jurisdictional requirement that certain services or health conditions are reported to a monitoring program, e.g., immunizations, methadone treatment, or cancer registries.ORGPOL (organizational policy)Examples:A clinical or research protocols imposed by a payer, a malpractice insurer, or an institution to which a provider must adhere. A mandate imposed by a denominational institution for a provider to provide or withhold certain information from the patient about treatment options.SCOPOL (scope of practice policy)Description:An ethical or clinical obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation imposed or strongly encouraged by organizations that oversee particular clinical domains or provider certification which define the boundaries within which a provider may practice and which may have legal basis or ramifications.Examples:An ethical obligation for a provider to fully inform a patient about all treatment options. An ethical obligation for a provider not to disclose personal health information that meets certain criteria, e.g., where disclosure might result in harm to the patient or another person. The set of health care services which a provider is credentialed or privileged to provide. STDPOL (standard of practice policy) Examples:A payer may require a prescribing provider to adhere to formulary guidelines. An institution may adopt clinical guidelines and protocols and implement these within its electronic health record and decision support systems.  CONS (consent)Description: The Consent class represents informed consents and all similar medico-legal transactions between the patient (or his legal guardian) and the provider. Examples are informed consent for surgical procedures, informed consent for clinical trials, advanced beneficiary notice, against medical advice decline from service, release of information agreement, etc.  The details of consents vary. Often an institution has a number of different consent forms for various purposes, including reminding the physician about the topics to mention. Such forms also include patient education material. In electronic medical record communication, consents thus are information-generating acts on their own and need to be managed similar to medical activities. Thus, Consent is modeled as a special class of Act. The &quot;signatures&quot; to the consent document are represented electronically through Participation instances to the consent object. Typically an informed consent has Participation.typeCode of &quot;performer&quot;, the healthcare provider informing the patient, and &quot;consenter&quot;, the patient or legal guardian. Some consent may associate a witness or a notary public (e.g., living wills, advanced directives). In consents where a healthcare provider is not required (e.g. living will), the performer may be the patient himself or a notary public.</td> </tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subType</td><td>Examples of Contract or Policy subtypes in ActCodes:_ActCoverageTypeCode Definition: Set of codes indicating the type of insurance policy or program that pays for the cost of benefits provided to covered parties.

If an action was not performed, it is often clinically important to know why the action was not taken. RefusalReasonCode Description: Identifies why a request to add (or activate) a record is being refused. Examples include the receiving system not able to match the identifier and find that record in the receiving system, having no permission, or a detected issue exists which precludes the requested action.Examples from HL7 ActReason Code System: QUALIMP (quality improvement) Description:Operational activities conducted for the purposes of improving the quality of an activity, product, or service. _PatientProfileQueryReasonCode Description: A collection of concepts identifying why the patient's profile is being queried. _ActInformationManagementReason Description:The rationale or purpose for an act relating to information management, such as archiving information for the purpose of complying with an enterprise data retention policy. _ActInvalidReason (ActInvalidReason) Description: Types of reasons why a substance is invalid for use. _NonPerformanceReasonCode Description: The reason the action wasn't performed, e.g. why the medication was not taken.

 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contentDerivative</td><td>Maps partially to several v3 codes: ActClass: REG (registration) Description: Represents the act of maintaining information about the registration of its associated registered subject. The subject can be either an Act or a Role, and includes subjects such as lab exam definitions, drug protocol definitions, prescriptions, persons, patients, practitioners, and equipment.The registration may have a unique identifier - separate from the unique identification of the subject - as well as a core set of related participations and act relationships that characterize the registration event and aid in the disposition of the subject information by a receiving system. Observation: VERIF (Verification) Description: An act which describes the process whereby a 'verifying party' validates either the existence of the Role attested to by some Credential or the actual Vetting act and its details. TRFR (transfer) Description: The act of transferring information without the intent of imparting understanding about a topic to the subject that is the recipient or holder of the transferred information where the participation association must be RCV or HLD. _ActDetectedIssueManagementCode [abstract term] Description: Codes dealing with the management of Detected Issue observations. _ActInformationAccessContextCode [abstract term] Description: Concepts conveying the context in which authorization given under jurisdictional law, by organizational policy, or by a patient consent directive permits the collection, access, use or disclosure of specified patient health information. _ActListCode [abstract term]vDescription: Provides codes associated with ActClass value of LIST (working list).

 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;securityLabel</td><td>ActCode ObservationType:SECOBS [abstract term]Description: An observation identifying security metadata about an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make access control decisions. Security metadata are used to name security labels. Rationale: According to ISO/TS 22600-3:2009(E) A.9.1.7 SECURITY LABEL MATCHING, Security label matching compares the initiator's clearance to the target's security label. All of the following must be true for authorization to be granted:The security policy identifiers shall be identical.  The classification level of the initiator shall be greater than or equal to that of the target (that is, there shall be at least one value in the classification list of the clearance greater than or equal to the classification of the target), and For each security category in the target label, there shall be a security category of the same type in the initiator's clearance and the initiator's classification level shall dominate that of the target. Examples: SecurityObservationType security label fields include: Confidentiality classification; Compartment category; Sensitivity categorySecurity mechanisms used to ensure data integrity or to perform authorized data transformation Indicators of an IT resource completeness, veracity, reliability, trustworthiness, or provenance. Usage Note: SecurityObservationType codes designate security label field types, which are valued with an applicable SecurityObservationValue code as the &quot;security label tag&quot;.  _SecurityObservationValue [abstract term] Description: Observation values used to indicate security observation metadata.</td> </tr>

Participation.signatureText :: ED (0..1) Definition: A textual or multimedia depiction of the signature by which the participant endorses and accepts responsibility for his or her participation in the Act as specified in the Participation.typeCode. UsageNotes: The signature can be represented either inline or by reference according to the ED data type. Typical cases are 1) Paper-based signatures: the ED data type may refer to a document or other resource that can be retrieved through an electronic interface to a hardcopy archive. 2) Electronic signature: this attribute can represent virtually any electronic signature scheme. 3) Digital signature: this attribute can represent digital signatures by reference to a signature data block that is constructed in accordance to a digital signature standard, such as XML-DSIG, PKCS#7, PGP, etc. Examples: 1) An &quot;author&quot; participant assumes accountability for the truth of the Act statement to the best of his knowledge. 2) An information recipient only attests to the fact that he or she has received the information.</td> </tr>

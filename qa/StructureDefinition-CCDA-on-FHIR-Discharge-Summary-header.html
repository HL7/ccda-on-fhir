<p>The Discharge Summary is a document which synopsizes a patient's admission to a hospital, LTPAC provider, or other setting. It provides information for the continuation of care following discharge. The Joint Commission requires the following information to be included in the Discharge Summary (http://www.jointcommission.org/):</p>
<p>The reason for hospitalization (the admission)</p>
<p>The procedures performed, as applicable</p>
<p>The care, treatment, and services provided</p>
<p>The patients condition and disposition at discharge</p>
<p>Information provided to the patient and family</p>
<p>Provisions for follow-up care</p>
<p>The best practice for a Discharge Summary is to include the discharge disposition in the display of the header.</p>

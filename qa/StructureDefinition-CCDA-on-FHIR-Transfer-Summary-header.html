<p>This profile describes constraints for a Transfer Summary. The Transfer Summary standardizes critical information for exchange of information between providers of care when a patient moves between health care settings. Standardization of information used in this form will promote interoperability; create information suitable for reuse in quality measurement, public health, research, and for reimbursement.</p>

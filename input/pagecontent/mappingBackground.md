This [project's](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/C-CDA+to+and+from+US+Core+Mapping) goals, which were scoped independent of the original document-level profiles, are to establish prescriptive HL7 mapping transformation guidance for a round trip of the structural and vocabulary concept transformations between C-CDA and FHIR, with the CDA content scoped by using document types in C-CDA R2.1 and the C-CDA Companion Guide R2 and FHIR content scoped by US Core R4 and, by implication, US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI). 

In our first publication, we focused on the subset of domains that are recognized as the most exchangeable concepts in the industry. We decided to limit our first publication to Allergies, Problems, Medications, Immunizations, Procedures, Patient (PAMPI+) domains, acknowledging the various stages of each concept maturity, we included the entire work for these concepts.

		<b>Mapping Consensus</b>
		<p>Note that C-CDA → FHIR mappings had a significant exposure to achieve multi-vendor consensus. This included through two FHIR Connectathons (September 2022 and January 2023) and regular weekly engagement. Vendors participating in this process include:
    <ul>
      <li>Cerner (Oracle)</li>
      <li>Diameter Health (Availity)</li>
      <li>Google</li>
      <li>MDIX</li>
      <li>Redox</li>
      <li>Smile Digital Health</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>The FHIR → C-CDA mappings have only been piloted by a single company (Cerner/Oracle) at this time and have not achieved multi-vendor consensus or connectathon testing yet.</b>

One project goal was to create knowledge artifacts that would be both correct and unambiguous, enabling artifact users to produce consistent results and interpretation of the conveyed concepts. The project exercised the multi-step manual content review, and example-based quality approaches through connectathons with vendors and standards enthusiasts. The method taken in this project includes several approaches to achieve its goal. After initial baseline maps were established, weekly deep mapping meetings and reviews were held to achieve consensus. These meetings involved the realignment, consensus-seeking, and reformatting for various users and intents, including implementors, terminologists, regulatory and public health representatives, and strategists. 

In addition, the project team exercised the example-based approach through Connectathons with vendors and experts in the standards community. The approach involves distribute the same inbound C-CDA examples among the vendors, comparing the outbound FHIR resources generated by these vendors, and discussing with the group to achieve alignment in best practice recommendations during and beyond the Connectathons. Our team has been focused on the generated artifacts, regardless of the transformation technologies, so any vendor is empowered to achieve the same transformation results.

By establishing the HL7 mapping transformation guidance, the project provides clarity and consistency in translating data between C-CDA and FHIR and back. This clarity and consistency are critical to ensure interoperability and communication across different healthcare systems, devices, applications and ensure accurate public reporting and analytics. Ultimately,  consistent transforms between standards reduces amount of the duplicated patient data artifacts and lead to better patient care and improved healthcare outcomes. In addition, this work clearly identifies elements where divergent assumptions impede reliably correct and unambiguous translation. These elements may present opportunities for refining the standards.

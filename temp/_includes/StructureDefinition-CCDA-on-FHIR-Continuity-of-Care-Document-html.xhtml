The Continuity of Care Document (CCD) profile represents a core data set of the most relevant administrative, demographic, and clinical information facts about a patient's healthcare, covering one or more healthcare encounters. It provides a means for one healthcare practitioner, system, or setting to aggregate all of the pertinent data about a patient and forward it to another to support the continuity of care.  

The primary use case for the CCD is to provide a snapshot in time containing the germane clinical, demographic, and administrative data for a specific patient. The key characteristic of a CCD is that the Composition.event.code is constrained to &quot;PCPR&quot;. This means it does not function to report new services associated with performing care. It reports on care that has already been provided. The CCD provides a historical tally of the care over a range of time and is not a record of new services delivered.

More specific use cases, such as a Discharge Summary, Transfer Summary, Referral Note, Consultation Note, or Progress Note, are available as alternative profiles.</p><p><b>url</b>: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ccda/StructureDefinition/CCDA-on-FHIR-Continuity-of-Care-Document">http://hl7.org/fhir/ccda/StructureDefinition/CCDA-on-FHIR-Continuity-of-Care-Document</a></p><p><b>name</b>: C-CDA on FHIR Continuity of Care Document</p><p><b>status</b>: DRAFT</p><p><b>publisher</b>: Lantana Consulting Group</p><p><b>contact</b>: </p><p><b>date</b>: Jan 4, 2017 11:36:09 PM</p><p><b>description</b>: This profile was originally based on the Continuity of Care Document (CCD) Release 1.1 which itself was derived from HITSP C32 and CCD Release 1.0.

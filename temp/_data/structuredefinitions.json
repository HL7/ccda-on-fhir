It serves as a blueprint shared by all Care Team Members (including the patient, their caregivers and providers), to guide the patients care. A Care Plan integrates multiple interventions proposed by multiple providers and disciplines for multiple conditions.\n\nA Care Plan represents one or more Plan(s) of Care and serves to reconcile and resolve conflicts between the various Plans of Care developed for a specific patient by different providers. While both a plan of care and a care plan include the patients life goals and require Care Team Members (including patients) to prioritize goals and interventions, the reconciliation process becomes more complex as the number of plans of care increases. The Care Plan also serves to enable longitudinal coordination of care.\n\nThe Care Plan represents an instance of this dynamic Care Plan at a point in time. The composition itself is NOT dynamic.\n\nKey differentiators between a Care Plan profile and CCD  profile (another snapshot in time document):\n\n*  Requires relationships between various concepts:\n\n        *  Health Concerns\n\n        *  Interventions\n\n        *  Goals\n\n        *  Outcomes\n\n*  Provides the ability to identify patient and provider priorities with each act\n\n*  Provides a header participant to indicate occurrences of Care Plan review",

It provides a means for one healthcare practitioner, system, or setting to aggregate all of the pertinent data about a patient and forward it to another to support the continuity of care.  \n\nThe primary use case for the CCD is to provide a snapshot in time containing the germane clinical, demographic, and administrative data for a specific patient. The key characteristic of a CCD is that the Composition.event.code is constrained to \"PCPR\". This means it does not function to report new services associated with performing care. It reports on care that has already been provided. The CCD provides a historical tally of the care over a range of time and is not a record of new services delivered.\n\nMore specific use cases, such as a Discharge Summary, Transfer Summary, Referral Note, Consultation Note, or Progress Note, are available as alternative profiles.",

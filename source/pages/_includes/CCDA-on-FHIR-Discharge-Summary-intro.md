The Discharge Summary is a document which synopsizes a patient's admission to a hospital, LTPAC provider, or other setting. It provides information for the continuation of care following discharge. The Joint Commission requires the following information to be included in the Discharge Summary (http://www.jointcommission.org/):

  The reason for hospitalization (the admission) 

  The procedures performed, as applicable

  The care, treatment, and services provided

  The patients condition and disposition at discharge

  Information provided to the patient and family

  Provisions for follow-up care

The best practice for a Discharge Summary is to include the discharge disposition in the display of the header.

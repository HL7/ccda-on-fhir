The C-CDA on FHIR Participant Extension identifies supporting entities, including parents, relatives, caregivers, insurance policyholders, guarantors, and others related in some way to the patient. A supporting person or organization is an individual or an organization with a relationship to the patient. A supporting person who is playing multiple roles would be recorded in multiple participants (e.g., emergency contact and next-of-kin).

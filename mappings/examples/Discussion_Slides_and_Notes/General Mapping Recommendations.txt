General Mapping Recommendations:
1. For codable concepts, map the originalText from the C-CDA to the coding.text attribute (using the reference link as needed to obtain the actual text before mapping)
2. For codable concepts with translations, map the translations to coding.code array, following the main entry
3. For identifier mapping, please refer to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EhRiTh3-wOd6t0eQa2iKD4RQ-A32aqNju1R0rG-afgE/edit#gid=2143847847 for the full mapping logic
